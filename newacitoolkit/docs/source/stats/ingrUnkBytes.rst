unclassifiedAvg   integer     | **Ingress unclassified bytes average**. 
                              | This is the average value read by the counter during the 
                              | collection interval. Note that this value resets to 0 at the 
                              | beginning of each interval. 
unclassifiedCum   integer     | **Ingress unclassified bytes cumulative**. 
                              | The total sum of the values read. Note that this value continues 
                              | through each interval without resetting to zero. 
unclassifiedMax   integer     | **Ingress unclassified bytes max value read**. 
                              | This is the largest value read by the counter during the 
                              | collection interval. This value is only overwritten if the most 
                              | current value is larger than the previous value. For example, if 
                              | the value of the first reading is 3 and the value of the second 
                              | reading is 4, the previous value is overwritten with 4. If the 
                              | third reading is smaller than 4, the value remains at 4. Note 
                              | that this value resets to 0 at the beginning of each interval. 
unclassifiedMin   integer     | **Ingress unclassified bytes min value read**. 
                              | This is the smallest value read by the counter during the 
                              | collection interval. This value is only overwritten if the most 
                              | current value is smaller than the previous value. For example, 
                              | if the value of the first reading is 3 and the value of the 
                              | second reading is 2, the previous value is overwritten with 2. 
                              | If the third reading is larger than 2, the value remains at 2. 
                              | Note that this value resets to 0 at the beginning of each 
                              | interval. 
unclassifiedPer   integer     | **Ingress unclassified bytes per interval**. 
                              | The total sum of the values read during the collection interval. 
                              | Note that this value resets to 0 at the beginning of each 
                              | interval. 
unclassifiedRate  float       | **Ingress packet rate**. 
                              | This is the rate of the counter during the collection interval. 
                              | The rate is calculated by dividing the periodic value by the 
                              | length of the collection interval in seconds. Note that this 
                              | value resets to 0 at the beginning of each interval. 
unicastAvg        integer     | **Ingress unknown unicast bytes average**. 
                              | This is the average value read by the counter during the 
                              | collection interval. Note that this value resets to 0 at the 
                              | beginning of each interval. 
unicastCum        integer     | **Ingress unknown unicast bytes cumulative**. 
                              | The total sum of the values read. Note that this value continues 
                              | through each interval without resetting to zero. 
unicastMax        integer     | **Ingress unknown unicast bytes max value read**. 
                              | This is the largest value read by the counter during the 
                              | collection interval. This value is only overwritten if the most 
                              | current value is larger than the previous value. For example, if

                              | reading is 4, the previous value is overwritten with 4. If the 
                              | third reading is smaller than 4, the value remains at 4. Note 
                              | that this value resets to 0 at the beginning of each interval. 
unicastMin        integer     | **Ingress unknown unicast bytes min value read**. 
                              | This is the smallest value read by the counter during the

                              | If the third reading is larger than 2, the value remains at 2. 
                              | Note that this value resets to 0 at the beginning of each 
                              | interval.

                              | The total sum of the values read during the collection interval.
