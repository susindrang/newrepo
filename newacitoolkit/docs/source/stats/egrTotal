Note that this                               | value resets to 0 at the beginning of each                               | interval. bytesCum          integer     | **Egress bytes cumulative**.                               | The total sum of the values read. Note that this                               | value continues through each interval without                               | resetting to zero. bytesMax          integer     | **Egress bytes maximum**.                               | This is the largest value read by the counter                               | during the collection interval.

For example, if                               | the value of the first reading is 3 and the value                               | of the second reading is 4, the previous value is                               | overwritten with 4. If the third reading is                               | smaller than 4, the value remains at 4. Note that                               | this value resets to 0 at the beginning of each                               | interval. bytesMin          integer     | **Egress bytes minimum**.                               | This is the smallest value read by the counter                               | during the collection interval. This value is                               | only overwritten if the most current value is                               | smaller than the previous value.

If the third reading is                               | larger than 2, the value remains at 2. Note that                               | this value resets to 0 at the beginning of each                               | interval. bytesPer          integer     | **Egress bytes per interval**.                               | The total sum of the values read during the                               | collection interval.

The rate is calculated by                               | dividing the periodic value by the length of the                               | collection interval in seconds. Note that this                               | value resets to 0 at the beginning of each                               | interval. bytesRateAvg      float       | **Egress byte rate average**.                               | This is the average value read by the counter                               | during the collection interval. This value resets                               | to 0 at the beginning of each interval and is in                               | bytes per second. bytesRateMax      float       | **Egress byte rate maximum**.                               | This is the largest value read by the counter                               | during the collection interval.
