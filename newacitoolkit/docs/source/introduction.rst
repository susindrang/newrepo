Introduction
============
The Cisco ACI Fabric is configured using an abstract policy model on the
Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC).  The APIC
has a very rich and complete object model that is accessible through a
programmatic REST API.  The acitoolkit exposes a small subset of that
model in a way that is meant to provide an introduction to the
ACI concepts and allow users to get the most common workflows up and
running as quickly as possible.
